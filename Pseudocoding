Directions:
Sort cards into stacks of 3
Make card stacks responsive using Boostrap, so on desktop size there are 2 card stacks per row. On mobile there is one card stack per row.
On “layered” card click, re-sort to put clicked card on top of card pile. If top card clicked, enlarge card as a modal. Time, location, and tags.
